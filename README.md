## Description
This is the production fronted repo for the site [abogadamagdiele.com](https://www.abogadamagdiele.com)

Magdiele Mendoza is a lawyer specialized in the commercial and civil area, she lives and works in Caracas, Venezuela.

### History
I built this site two times, in the first time I used basic web tecnologies as:

+ HTML
+ CSS 
+ JavaScript
+ Bootstrap css clases

I bought the domain on GoogleDomains, and used github for hosted the site. You can find the [first version online on github](https://abogadamagdiele.github.com). The biggest problem with that version is that the contact form dosen't work and I wanted to offer a customer contact form. You can see the [CODE HERE](https://github.com/abogadamagdiele/abogadamagdiele.github.io)

So I decide make some changes, for this version a keep using Bootstrap css clases  but insted of plain HTML I used:

+ React + Nextjs
+ Django + DRF

I get a fundamental knowlege about react and nextjs, and used it for built the frontend. for the backend I felt more comfortable using Django.
